// turn and applied from memory for hours afterwards. The author of that skill
// then broke three of its rules in a single PR — merged a PR eight rounds after
// its bar was met, patched one surface for three consecutive rounds instead of
// making the scope decision, and added new files at round four. None of that was
// disagreement with the rules; it was not knowing, in the moment, what round it
// was or what the last three rounds had landed on.
//
// So the state is measured from GitHub and printed. Every rule that can be
// decided from data is decided here rather than by recall.

// zero, and pushed the merge onto §7's hard stop instead of the bar. A finding
// that is wrong should not be able to block a merge for ever.
