// What the head's CI says, as problems. Pure: pr-gate.mjs hands it the check-runs, the legacy
// commit statuses and the workflow runs it fetched, so the rule is testable without the API.
//
// Two holes this closes (one PR: MERGE ALLOWED with "0 check(s) green" while CI was queued):
//  - A head with NO checks at all is not green. Between a push and Actions registering its runs
//    there are zero check-runs, and an empty set passed every loop below it.
//  - A queued re-run has no `started_at`, so choosing the newest run by `started_at` kept the OLD
//    completed run and hid the queued one. The newest run of a name is the higher id.
