// Two holes this closes (one PR: MERGE ALLOWED with "0 check(s) green" while CI was queued):
//  - A head with NO checks at all is not green. Between a push and Actions registering its runs
//    there are zero check-runs, and an empty set passed every loop below it.
//  - A queued re-run has no `started_at`, so choosing the newest run by `started_at` kept the OLD
//    completed run and hid the queued one. The newest run of a name is the higher id.

// is in progress it would block a merge the watcher has already reported green (pr-watch.mjs
// leaves it out by the same test). Matched on the reviewer's exact identity, never a substring.
