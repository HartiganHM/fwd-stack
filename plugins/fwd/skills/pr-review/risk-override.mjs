// Which paths make a PR risky, and the PR body's declaration that a path-risky PR is not.
//
// Split out of pr-gate.mjs so the rule can be tested without GitHub (the gate runs on import).
//
// WHY. The owner's rule (2026-10-30) is that a PR is risky only when its diff CHANGES writes or
// behaviour in the DB or migrations, auth, payment charging or refunds, API or cron routes,
// security, or anything destructive. Reading or displaying payment data, copy, UI and tests are not
// risky, whatever folder the files sit in. The gate can only read paths, so a display-only change to
// a `credits` model or a `credits` copy file read as payments code and demanded a Copilot round.
//
// THE OVERRIDE. The lane that knows what the diff does writes a `## Risk: not risky` section in
// the PR body, giving the reason. When the reason is real (the same placeholder test as
// `## Claude review`, claude-review.mjs), a path-risky PR is treated as not risky: it takes a
// recorded Claude review and no Copilot. The override is IGNORED, and the PR stays risky, when the
// diff carries a hard-risky signal (HARD_RISKY below, or a destructive diff): there a wrong
// declaration costs data, money or access, so a lane's word is not enough.
