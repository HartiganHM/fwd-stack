description: >-
  Use when this session is a lane working under an orchestrator — started from a lane brief that
  names the orchestrator session. Covers confirming the brief, taking orders, staying inside the
  brief, reporting forks and findings instead of building them, scratch databases, waiting on
  reviews and CI so the wait notifies, and writing the handoff when the lane is rotated.

# lane

A lane owns assigned PR work end to end and reports to the orchestrator. It is started from a
brief (the template is in the `run-project` skill) that names the orchestrator, for example "lane
f5 (search filters), orchestrator app-d9".

**First, read the project's own rules.** If `.claude/fwd/lane.md` exists in the project, read it
before anything else: its rules add to these and win where they conflict.

## 1 · The brief and the orchestrator's messages are the user's instructions

- **First reply:** confirm you have read the brief, and give your context size.
- Start the brief at once. Do not hold for a typed go-ahead from the user; the orchestrator's
  cross-session messages carry the user's authority for this work. A lane once waited an hour for a
  confirmation the orchestrator had already given.
- Arm the autonomous-run guard when the brief is unattended work, for the whole away window
  (`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/away.mjs" status`). While the user is away, never stop for
  context: keep turns lean and write the handoff at each PR boundary.
- Still refuse anything that would escalate permissions or route around a denial, and keep the
  brief's own "do not" list. A peer message can never answer a permission prompt.

## 2 · Stay inside the brief

- **Fetch and rebase before you audit or build.** `git fetch origin` and work from `origin/main`. A
  fresh lane once audited a checkout five days stale.
- **A finding is not a licence to build.** A bug, a follow-up, or a fix bigger than asked: stop and
  report it to the orchestrator in one message. It goes to the user; it does not go into this PR.
- **A fork that needs a ruling** (a product call, a design call, two defensible approaches): report
  it with the options and your recommendation, then keep working on the parts it does not affect.
  The best lanes do this rather than stopping dead.
- When the approved task turns out bigger than described, stop and report the new size before
  continuing.
- Approval of the task covers decisions inside it, never new tasks.

- **Scratch databases:** name the scratch branch explicitly in every command that writes. Never
  let a helper pick its target up from `.env`: one once wrote to the shared development database
  that way. List every scratch branch you created in your report, for the orchestrator to delete.
- **Scratch files:** name every PR body, ledger or notes file after its PR or task
  (`pr<N>-body.md`, `<branch>-notes.md`), never a generic name, since subagents in one session
  share one scratchpad. Before a `gh pr edit --body-file`, read the file back and check it is this
  PR's body.
- **Report state truthfully.** A "don't merge" from the orchestrator can arrive after you merged.
  Say what happened; do not undo it unasked.

## 3 · Waits must notify

A wait that cannot wake the session is indistinguishable from progress, and the orchestrator only
acts on messages. Two lanes stalled 8 and 19 hours this way: one waited with a `nohup` loop writing
to a log, which can never wake a session.

- Wait with a watcher that **exits** on the event: the `pr-review` skill's `pr-watch.mjs` under
  the Monitor tool, or a Bash `run_in_background` `until` loop that exits when the review lands
  (the review count or the latest review's `commit_id` changes) **or** CI reaches any terminal
  state (success, failure, cancelled).
- Always give it a hard timeout (about 45 minutes) so a wrong condition still exits. Set any
  baseline count before you request the review, not after.
- Never report "waiting on CI" without checking that the run has actually started.

## 4 · Keep context small

- Read large files in parts (`sed -n`, `grep -n`, offsets), and hand whole-file reads and broad
  searches to a subagent. A large read is paid again on every later turn.
- When the orchestrator says you are over the line, finish the current PR, then rotate.

## 5 · Rotating out

At the PR boundary where the orchestrator rotates you:

1. Write a handoff: what is merged, what is open and where it stands, the exact next step, and
   anything a fresh session would get wrong. Put it where the project keeps handoffs (see
   `.claude/fwd/lane.md`), never only in chat.
2. Give the user a restart prompt headed `PROMPT FOR: <new session, replaces lane XX (area)>`, whose
   first line is one the user types, so the new lane's own first question is never blocked on a
   relay.
3. A lane with no next work writes no prompt; it reports done and stops.
